        His target and the young girl were inside. Warm and comfortable, secure in the knowledge that this was there home and that despite the uncertainty and horrors of the world; inside this small space they were safe. On the other hand there was Vega, cold and wet, crouching on a rooftop making sure that his movements are silent so as to not alert the two inside.

He was there to show these people that the real monsters in this world don’t give a damn if you hide under the covers or shine a lamp at them under the bed. No the real monsters Want to look into your eyes as you realize that everything you thought you knew about being safe was a lie.
