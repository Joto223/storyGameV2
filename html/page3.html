        When Vega gets closer he sees his target by the fireplace but he is not alone there is a young girl next to him she was about 14 or 15
        <br>
        <br>
        As he watches them sit by the fire talking, Vega's conflicted thoughts come to the surface. The idea of taking a life has always made him uneasy, but this moment is what his entire life has been leading up to. All other lessons were learned, and all other tests were passed.  All that was left to cement his skills, and obtain the title of assassin was to end a life.
