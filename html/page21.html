        Vega had nothing to fear from (User), with no weapons and no martial arts training. Regardless he still felt a tinge of excitement, if he was discovered then the decision to kill was out of his hands. He would be fighting for his life and for some reason this simplified things. Vega stood his ground preparing for a fight but he did not move. (User) squinted into the darkness, looked right past Vega, and seeing nothing he began to run back towards the house carrying the firewood and covering it with his body so that it wouldn’t get wet leaving Vega alone and in the dark. His target was gone, his first mission was a failure and his master was going to be furious.
