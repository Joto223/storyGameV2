        When Vega was young he once asked his master about the killing and if that made them the bad guys, at nine years old Vega didn’t like the idea of being the bad guy in his own story. His master simply smiled and said that he was thinking about it all wrong. "From the moment the contract goes out the targets are already dead". Without any doubt or hesitation his master continued, "as assassins we are nether good or bad were simple tools and tools have no say as to how they are used."
        <br>
        <br>
        On the one hand there was his target and the young girl inside. Warm and comfortable, secure in the knowledge that this was there home and that despite the uncertainty and horrors of the world; inside this small space they were safe. On the other hand there was Vega, cold and wet, crouching on a rooftop making sure that his movements are silent so as to not alert the two inside. Alert them to the fact that the world didn’t care about their stupid walls. He was there to show these people that the real monsters in this world don’t give a damn if you hide under the covers or shine a lamp at them under the bed. No the real monsters Want to look into your eyes as you realize that everything you thought you knew about being safe was a lie.
        <br>
        <br>
        As he worked to sabotage the mechanism that keeps water out of the chimney his master’s words repeated over and over in Vega’s mind like some sort of mantra. Or more like a prayer to some lost unknown god that could absolve him of all of his fears and guilt.
