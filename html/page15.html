        He made his way to the side of the house on the balls of his feet moving with the grace and silence of a predator. Vega was fairly certain that the rain would cover any minor sounds that he made. But his master’s voice seemed to be coming from inside his head and while it was guiding him into darkness it was the only guidance that he had ever known. Also, something about performing these actions that he had spent his entire life perfecting brought him a small measure of peace.
        <br>
        <br>
        Positioning himself behind a tree with a view of the woodshed Vega was confident that he could close the distance quickly and quietly enough to take his target unawares. All that was left to do was wait for his target to arrive.
        <br>
        <br>
        The plan was simple, cause a leak in the chimney to put out the fire and then wait for his target to come and get more wood to restart the blaze and that was when he would strike.

        (User) … Vega had never used the deader name before. How could he, and what did the name mater. His master never gave a name, just a description and a location. Names didn’t matter the outcome was the same so what was the point. But looking at the person in front of him he couldn’t stop dwelling on the fact this deader name was (User). His heart started to beat faster as Vega reached for the dagger strapped to his lower back. As his hand touched the once familiar grip it began to shake. (User) has a life, people who care about them, people who will miss them when they are gone.
