        Vega moved like a streak of midnight, unsheathing his dagger in one fluid well-rehearsed movement. When Vega buried the dagger in (User) s chest. In the end (User) was surprised, they knew that death was coming, but when it finally arrived (User) still could not believe that they were actually dying. The look on (User) s face would forever be burned into Vega's memory. Because it wasn’t hatred, anger or even fear that Vega saw, those emotions he could understand and would have even welcomed, he did deserve it after all. No in the end (User) looked up at Vega with a deep soul crushing sadness that Vega couldn’t fathom. Why was he sad? Was it because he was about to die? Was he sad about the ending of his own life?
